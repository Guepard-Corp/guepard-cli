# Multi-Platform Build Setup Summary

## Overview
Successfully configured the Guepard CLI to support multi-platform builds for AMD64 and ARM64 architectures across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Cargo.toml
- Binary name is `guepard`
- Added multi-platform metadata configuration
- Added platform-specific features for keyring support
- Updated package description and metadata

### 2. Created Build Infrastructure
- **build.sh**: Comprehensive build script for all platforms
- **Makefile**: Developer-friendly build commands
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflow for automated builds
- **Cross-compilation support**: Using `cross` tool for easier cross-compilation

### 3. Updated CLI Structure
- Restructured commands to be Git-like (`init`, `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, etc.)
- Simplified command hierarchy
- Added new commands: `init`, `commit`, `log`, `rev-parse`
- Updated existing commands to match Git syntax

### 4. Platform Support Matrix
| Platform | Architecture | Status | Binary Name |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Linux    | AMD64 (x86_64) | ✅ | `guepard` |
| Linux    | ARM64 (aarch64) | ✅ | `guepard` |
| Windows  | AMD64 (x86_64) | ✅ | `guepard.exe` |
| Windows  | ARM64 (aarch64) | ✅ | `guepard.exe` |
| macOS    | AMD64 (x86_64) | ✅ | `guepard` |
| macOS    | ARM64 (aarch64) | ✅ | `guepard` |

## Build Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Install cross-compilation tools
make install-tools

# Run tests
make test
```

### Cross-Compilation
```bash
# Build for all platforms
./build.sh all

# Install tools only
./build.sh install-tools

# Clean build artifacts
./build.sh clean
```

## GitHub Actions
- Automated builds on push to main/develop branches
- Builds for all 6 target platforms
- Creates release archives when tags are pushed
- Generates checksums for all binaries
- Runs tests and linting

## File Structure
```
guepard-cli/
├── build.sh              # Multi-platform build script
├── Makefile              # Developer commands
├── .github/workflows/    # CI/CD workflows

├── dist/                 # Build outputs (created during build)
└── README.md             # Updated documentation
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Create release tags to test automated releases
3. Set up package repositories (Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.)
4. Add more comprehensive testing for cross-compiled binaries

## Notes
- Cross-compilation from macOS to Linux requires additional system dependencies
- The `cross` tool is recommended for easier cross-compilation
- Platform-specific features are automatically selected based on target
- All builds create both individual binaries and compressed archives
